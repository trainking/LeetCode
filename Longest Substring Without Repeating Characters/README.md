# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

提供一个字符创，找出其中最长不重复的子字符串的长度。

## 例子

case: "abcabcbb", out: 3, because: "abc"

case："bbbbb", out: 1, because: "b"

case: "pwwkew", out: 3, because: "wke"

> 字符串必须是连续的
